<p style='color: White;'> BTS is my top 1 most favorite Kpop group of all time! I've been their fan for 3 years and I am still an ARMY! They have made many famous songs and those are FAKE LOVE, DYNAMITE, and Butter! They have won 5 GRAMMY AWRADS and hundreds of Billboard awards, I truly will always be their no.1 fan! :DDDD </p>
